The CAT question paper comprises MCQs & non-MCQs from Verbal Ability & Reading Comprehension (VARC), Data Interpretation & Logical Reasoning (DILR), and Quantitative Ability (QA). Over two lakh candidates appear in the CAT exam every year. For CAT 2020, about 2.30 lakh applications were received and the total number of candidates who took the test was 1.90 lakh.</p>
